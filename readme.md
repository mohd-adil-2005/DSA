# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my DSA repository! 🎓 

This repository contains my solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems from **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and other platforms. It focuses on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented Java code. 

I have also included a **curated list of important interview questions** that are frequently asked by top tech companies.

## 📌 Repository Highlights

- **☕ Language:** Java
- **🧠 Topics Covered:** Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, DP, Recursion, and more.
- **⚡ Efficiency:** Focus on Time and Space Complexity optimization ($O(n)$, $O(\log n)$).
- **📝 Documentation:** Comments explaining the logic and approach for complex problems.

## 🔥 Top Interview Questions (Cheat Sheet)

I maintain a special collection of high-probability interview questions. These are the patterns that appear most often in technical rounds.

| Topic | Problem | Difficulty | Solution Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DP** | Longest Common Subsequence | Medium | [View Code](./DynamicProgramming/LCS.java) |
| **DP** | Longest Palindromic Subsequence | Medium | [View Code](./DynamicProgramming/LPS.java) |
| **Arrays** | Two Sum | Easy | [View Code](./Arrays/TwoSum.java) |
| **Strings** | Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | Medium | [View Code](./Strings/LongestSubstring.java) |
| **Graph** | Number of Islands | Medium | [View Code](./Graph/NumIslands.java) |

*(I update this table regularly as I solve more important problems!)*
